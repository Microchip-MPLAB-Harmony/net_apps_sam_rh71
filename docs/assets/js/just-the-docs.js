Please refer to the following connection diagram. | All the TCP/IP Application Demonstration projects that are part of this distribution use the Microchip hardware development boards. They are pre-configured with specific PHY Drivers. The TCP/IP application demonstrations assume that IPv4 is enabled. If IPv4 is not enabled in MHC, the code in app.c will not build and needs to be updated to remove the IPv4 dependencies. | All the demos have DHCP enabled, and expect a DHCP server to be available. If there is no DHCP server, then the default static IP address will be used: 192.168.100.11. If this static address does not match your network settings, use MPLAB® Harmony Configurator (MHC) to modify the static IP address of the network interface. | The NetBIOS name of the TCP/IP application is specified during the initialization of TCP/IP stack. It is the hostName member of TCPIP_HOSTS_CONFIGURATION structure. The NetBIOS service must be enabled in demonstration configuration, for the TCP/IP demonstration to respond to NetBIOS queries. Alternatively, use the IPv4 or IPv6 address (if IPv6 is enabled) of the board directly. | The IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be obtained by running the TCP/IP Discovery utility on the computer.

A brief description of the most important settings/commands follows: . | “iperf”: starts the iperf session. Use “iperf -s” for a server connection or “iperf -c address” for a client connection . | Look at the Iperf Module for examples of iperf benchmarks | . | “iperfk” kills an ongoing iperf test. This is mainly useful for killing a iperf server waiting for connections. But the command could be also used to abort client test. | “iperfi -a address” allows to set the interface to use for iperf when the test is run on a multi-interface host. When multiple iperf instabces are used, the extra parameter “-i” could be used to specify the iperf index to which the command refers to. | “iperfs” command could be used to set the socket TX or RX buffer size dynamically. For example: . | “iperfs -tx 2048” | . | . Note: . | The iperf demo uses very few TCP/IP modules, to minimize the stack overhead and to obtain good throughput numbers. | However ICMP server, NBNS and Announce modules are enabled to assist in the discovery of the board on the network. | DHCP client is also enabled for acquiring a valid IP address within the network. | Some of these modules could be further disabled if they are not used in the specific network environment of the application. | . | The data throughput could vary dependent on the iperf socket settings and the network conditions. | Larger TX and RX buffers will increase the corresponding throughput. | Various devices on the network on the link between the board and the machine running the iperf application (switches, routers, etc.) could also affect the throughput. | User can eliminate these effects by connecting the board running the iperf demo directly to the machine running the test on the PC side (Linux, Windows, etc.) . | . | . | .
